# AudioChatbot
When you first run the script, make sure to edit the configurations with 'your' in it as those configurations are necessary for the script to run properly 

Notes:
- I recommend to create a folder called chatbotfiles to send the audio files to a specific location
- The key to start recording is 'K'
- The paths for voice_filepath and bot_voice_filepath should end with voiceRecording.wav and bot_voice.mp3 respectivly
- You need to create a free HuggingChat account in order to use this script
