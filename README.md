# AudioChatbot
When you first run the script, make sure to edit all of the configurations with 'your' in it, as those configurations are necessary for the script to run properly 

Notes:
- I recommend to create a folder called chatbotfiles to send the audio files to a specific location
- The default key to start recording is 'K'
- The paths for voice_filepath and bot_voice_filepath should end with voiceRecording.wav and bot_voice.mp3 respectively
- You need to create a free HuggingChat account in order to use this script
